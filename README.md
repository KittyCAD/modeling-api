# KittyCAD's Modeling API

This defines the API KittyCAD provides for you to model 3D objects.

# Beware

This project does not use semver. We are using 0.1.x for everything. If you use this crate, commit your Cargo.lock to avoid being broken when we publish a new version. 

Why? Because we use this primarily for KittyCAD server and clients, where we are on top of all changes.
